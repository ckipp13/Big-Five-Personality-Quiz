A terminal-based psychological quiz application created for an Object-Oriented Programming course.

---

## üìò Overview

This program administers the **Big Five Personality Test**, a widely used psychological model for understanding five key dimensions of personality:

- üü£ **Openness to Experience**  
- üîµ **Conscientiousness**  
- üü¢ **Extraversion**  
- üü° **Agreeableness**  
- üî¥ **Neuroticism**

After taking the 50-question quiz, users receive visual feedback through **bar graphs and a pie chart**, as well as a saved profile summarizing their results.

## üîÑ Process

This program was originally scoped to demonstrate object-oriented design by creating structured user personas and quiz logic. However, our team expanded its functionality to include:

- **Input validation**
- **Visual result generation**
- **Persistent file storage**

The project reflects foundational concepts in Python programming, data handling, and user-centric design ‚Äî all within a terminal-based environment.
